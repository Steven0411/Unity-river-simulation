Unity River project

In order to run this project it must be opened in Unity game engine.

Once the project is open and you press the play button in the editor you will have to select four points on the plane.
These points will then make a Bezier curve. Once the curve is made click again to confirm the shape and watch the river.
When you want to make a new river press reset in the bottom left corner and select four new points to make a new shape.
